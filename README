 - a -> Order the list of files alphabetically
 - r -> Reverse the list of files
 - SpaceBar -> Scroll the selected file
 - h or F1 -> Show the help screen, press Page Up/Down to scroll up and down,
              h and F1 again to hide
 - d -> Remove log files, usage is similar to vim "d" command, here are
        same examples:
        da -> Remove all files
        de -> Remove from selected item to the end of the list
        ds -> Remove from selected item to the start of the list
        d1d or dd -> Remove selected file only
        d4d -> Remove 4 files starting from selected one
